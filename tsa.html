    <h1>Our Chapter</h1>    
    <h4 style="margin: auto; text-transform: none;">
        Seminole High’s TSA chapter is in its second year of development with Kashyap Sreeram founding it in his freshman year and running as current President. Vishal Dubey is the current Vice-President with club advisor Kevin Strileckis, secretary Travis Xiang, treasurer Tanuj Prajapati, reporter Anusha Sikand, and sergeant at arms Tanya Charan. They were elected by an application and request to make the club a better place. This year we have more than 70 members and are competing in nearly every competition for the TSA State Conference.

              Kashyap Sreeram, a junior in the IB program Seminole High School (Sanford), embarked on his TSA journey after founding his own chapter and serving as its President as a freshman, Seminole County’s first TSA chapter. Kashyap lives and breathes TSA; his passion for this organization has soared to huge heights. You can always find him giving presentations about TSA at school events or working to plan fundraisers and events for his local chapter. Kashyap enjoys the challenges thrown his way by being a part of this amazing organization and feels that it has truly made him a better leader, critical-thinker, and taught him the importance of teamwork. His favorite competitive events include Biotechnology Design, STEM Careers, and Technology Bowl. Aside from TSA, Kashyap loves to keep himself busy with a rigorous IB and AP course workload in school and engages himself after school as part of the school’s Academic Team, Vice President of Model United Nations, a member of the Junior Class Council and Mu Alpha Theta. Furthermore, outside of school, Kashyap has been an Indian Classical singer for 12 years, is a black belt in Taekwondo, and enjoys playing tennis. Kashyap aspires to go into the field of biochemistry and eventually become a neurosurgeon, currently participating in research to reach that goal.
